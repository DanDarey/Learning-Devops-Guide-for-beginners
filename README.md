# Learn DevOps for Free

Comprehensive DevOps guide for beginners! Dive into the world of DevOps with step-by-step tutorials, best practices, and hands-on exercises. Elevate your skills in automation, CI/CD, and cloud technologies. Perfect for those starting their DevOps journey! 

This guide has no specific crowd in mind. If you are not yet technical or working in tech but trying to switch to DevOps, this guide is just what you need. Also if you are already working in tech but would like to switch to DevOps Engineering, you're in the right place.

All materials listed below are free. I know what you might be thinking. If it is free, then maybe it isn't so good for the author to put it out there. You might be right. There is a lot of content out there that is free and the quality isn't so good however, there are top creators that are backed by major tech giants, and watching a video on YouTube isn't exactly free. You are paying with your time. 

Lastly, all of the creators I am linking their content here are professionals who spend lots of hours creating these top-notch materials/courses, so be sure to support them in any way possible. If it is a YouTube channel, like & subscribe. If it's a blog post, like/clap & share with others.

## Introduction to DevOps Theory
This section provides you with the material you need to understand the foundations / basic theory of DevOps and what the whole idea is. I do not intend to make this guide a tutorial, it will be impossible to provide the DevOps knowledge you need but instead, I want to point you in the right direction with the additional benefit being that you grab all the knowledge you need for FREE.

The mistake I and a lot of other people make is that they jump straight to the technical skills without spending time to understand what you are trying to achieve using an entire stack or even a particular tool. Skipping on these basics hurts you along the line because you miss the foundational knowledge that helps you understand the end goal and what DevOps brings to a business.

That said, the videos below are all you need to grasp the theoretical knowledge you need to get started.

- [What is DevOps?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yWAtQ6wYNM)

By the time you are done watching the videos above, you will have understood the basics of DevOps. If you have not worked in tech before, it might be hard for you to grasp some of the terminologies, and thats fine. Try to find resources online that explain some of the concepts you did not understand when watching the videos, even further.
